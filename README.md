We generated simulated MRI data and then applied the deep learning models to them. This be found in the 'Simulated Data Code' file.

We define the ground truth data for the deep learning models as 'params_sim'.

We use 'params_sim' to calculate the error between the estimates of the deep learning model, and the ground truth values in params_sim.
