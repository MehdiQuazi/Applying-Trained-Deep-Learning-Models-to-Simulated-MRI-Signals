We generated simulated MRI data and then applied the trained deep learning models to them. This be found in the 'Simulated Data Code' file. Run this in MATLAB.

We define the ground truth data for the deep learning models as 'params_sim'. This must be loaded into MATLAB.

We use 'params_sim' to calculate the error between the estimates of the deep learning model, and the ground truth values in params_sim.



NOTE: This requires the code to train the deep learning models which belongs to the original owners (Dr Marco Palombo and Dr Matteo Figini) who I could
not recieve permission from to share the code.
